The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of aerosol dispersion in disease transmission in indoor environments. The present study experimentally investigates the dispersion and build-up of an exhaled aerosol modeled with polydisperse microscopic particles (approximately 1 μm mean diameter) by a seated manikin in a relatively large indoor environment. The aims are to offer quantitative insight into the effect of common face masks and ventilation/air purification, and to provide relevant experimental metrics for modeling and risk assessment. Measurements demonstrate that all tested masks provide protection in the immediate vicinity of the host primarily through the redirection and reduction of expiratory momentum. However, leakages are observed to result in notable decreases in mask efficiency relative to the ideal filtration efficiency of the mask material, even in the case of high-efficiency masks, such as the R95 or KN95. Tests conducted in the far field (2 m distance from the subject) capture significant aerosol build-up in the indoor space over a long duration (10 h). A quantitative measure of apparent exhalation filtration efficiency is provided based on experimental data assimilation to a simplified model. The results demonstrate that the apparent exhalation filtration efficiency is significantly lower than the ideal filtration efficiency of the mask material. Nevertheless, high-efficiency masks, such as the KN95, still offer substantially higher apparent filtration efficiencies (60% and 46% for R95 and KN95 masks, respectively) than the more commonly used cloth (10%) and surgical masks (12%), and therefore are still the recommended choice in mitigating airborne disease transmission indoors. The results also suggest that, while higher ventilation capacities are required to fully mitigate aerosol build-up, even relatively low air-change rates (2 h−1) lead to lower aerosol build-up compared to the best performing mask in an unventilated space.
I. INTRODUCTION
Expiratory events, such as breathing, speaking, sneezing, or coughing, produce droplets, ranging in micrometers to millimeters in size, that serve as the primary pathway for the transmission of many infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1–6 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscored glaring gaps in our understanding of pathogen transmission required to effectively contain and prevent outbreaks, including, but not limited to, the development of reliable guidelines for safe social distancing,1,2 usage of personal protective equipment (PPE),7,8 and indoor ventilation.1,9 The initial guidelines released in early 2020 by the World Health Organization and many national health agencies assumed that COVID-19 spreads primarily through large droplets that settle on surfaces within 1 to 2 m from the infected individuals. Although an intense scientific debate on the main transmission pathways of COVID-19 continues,10,11 the mounting data on local outbreaks and relevant research9,12,13 have prompted significant modifications to official guidelines, which now attribute the spread of COVID-19 to a wide range of droplet sizes, including both larger respiratory droplets and microscopic aerosols, produced during various expiratory events.14–16
Recent research has shown that smaller droplets and droplet nuclei containing significant viral load can travel up to 8 m during expiratory events,3 substantially exceeding the present social distancing limits. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown to retain infectivity in aerosol form for a minimum of three hours past expiration from an infected person,5 making it possible for the pathogens to be transported over extended distances due to ambient flows in indoor environments.6,11,17–20 The critical importance of safety considerations at indoor workplaces has been recently highlighted by the analysis of various COVID-19 superspreader events,13 the vast majority of which took place indoors. This underscores the importance of understanding the spread and accumulation of human-borne aerosols in indoor environments through the lens of social distancing, mask usage, occupancy, exposure duration limits, and ventilation.
Another contentious issue brought to the forefront of scientific debates by the COVID-19 pandemic is the efficacy of face masks.7,8 Although some clinical evidence of respirator mask efficiency existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,21 there is mounting evidence that continuous usage of appropriate face masks can reduce the rate of virus transmission;7,8 however, the efficacy of different mask types for both the reduction of viral emissions and prevention of individual inhalation of pathogens requires further quantitative analysis.1,2 This is of particular importance for indoor settings, where PPE can significantly affect the accumulation of the pathogens and their transmission through filtration and reduction/redirection of momentum during expiratory events.
Recent observational studies and meta-analyses of mask effectiveness have estimated that mask usage reduces the risk of respiratory virus spread by 70% to 80%.22 Efficacy of home-made masks at preventing spread of influenza showed that surgical masks are three times more effective at blocking micro-organism transmission than home-made masks23–25 although none of these studies include randomized control trials.26 There is, however, evidence that communities in which masks were in widespread use exhibited significantly reduced community spread.24,25
The higher risk of infectious disease transmission in indoor environments, particularly with poor ventilation, has been recognized in the scientific community well before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic27 and prompted a number of studies on transmission and aerosol transport indoors.28–31 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has re-invigorated the research efforts in this area due to the growing association between local outbreaks and various indoor settings. For example, Qian et al.13 reported that all except one of the 318 analyzed COVID-19 outbreaks were associated with indoor spaces. Bhagat et al.32 provided an overview of potential effects of ventilation on the indoor spread of COVID-19, and general guidelines for minimizing airborne transmission are detailed in Morawska et al.11 Mittal, Meneveau, and Wu33 proposed a framework for estimating the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 based on probabilistic factors and highlighted the critical need for reliable quantification of key model parameters for future modeling and validation.
The airborne transmission of pathogens in indoor environment is directly related to the dynamics of virus-laden aerosols.28 The associated transmission risk models are based on either simplified analytical formulations34–36 or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools.17,33,37 The former typically employ a well-mixed room assumption, where pathogen carrying aerosols are assumed to be instantaneously and uniformly distributed in a given room, such as in the classical Wells–Riley equation.34 Such simplified modeling has also been employed for COVID-19 risk assessment.36,38 On the other hand, at the expense of notably higher computational costs and model complexity, CFD-based modeling can provide added insight into spatial evolution of aerosols produced by various expiratory events in realistic indoor environments. Along these lines, a number of studies have modeled airborne spread of COVID-19;17,39 however, all models rely on quantitative results from experimental studies for an array of input parameters, such as the initial number and size distribution of aerosol particles and initial velocities and duration of expiratory events. Further, the use of PPE, including face masks, needs to be incorporated into computational models, which either significantly complicates the modeling40 or requires experimental data.33 Thus, there is a need to incorporate the progress made in a number of recent qualitative and quantitative studies focused on PPE performance into larger-scale investigations focused on aerosol dispersion in indoor environments. This will provide a more comprehensive outlook on workplace health and safety, where the use of PPE is not only often mandated by local legislature, but also can help mitigate the limitation of available ventilation options.
The present study is aimed at bridging the gap between studies focused on face mask efficacy assessment and indoor dispersion of aerosols by experimentally evaluating the aerosol accumulation in a controlled indoor environment, with various types of face masks and ventilation settings considered. Typical nasal breathing is modeled in the present work using a high-fidelity physical model. While this type of expiration is known to produce the lowest aerosol counts per event, this type of breathing is the most common type of expiration and thus accounts for the majority of aerosol production during continuous occupancy at work and public places.41 A combination of flow visualization, velocity and concentration measurements, and modeling is used to provide a quantitative outlook on the effect of different face masks on aerosol build-up over extended time periods in a generic indoor setting. The result provides critical estimates of apparent filtration efficiency essential for producing adaptive health and safety guidelines for workplaces during pandemic and epidemic events as well as for the development of advanced modeling tools.
II. METHODOLOGY
Experiments were conducted in the Fluid Mechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Waterloo. An overview of the setup is provided in Fig. 1(a). All tests were performed in a 7.8×5.7×2.7 m room with an air volume of approximately 120 m3 that was vacated except for the test model and essential equipment. To study the dispersion of exhaled aerosols in an unventilated space, the room was sealed from all surroundings, which included shutting off the ventilation system and sealing all air passageways through the room envelope.ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.[21]
