On the other hand, at the expense of notably higher computational costs and model complexity, CFD-based modeling can provide added insight into spatial evolution of aerosols produced by various expiratory events in realistic indoor environments. Along these lines, a number of studies have modeled airborne spread of COVID-19;17,39 however, all models rely on quantitative results from experimental studies for an array of input parameters, such as the initial number and size distribution of aerosol particles and initial velocities and duration of expiratory events. Further, the use of PPE, including face masks, needs to be incorporated into computational models, which either significantly complicates the modeling40 or requires experimental data.33 Thus, there is a need to incorporate the progress made in a number of recent qualitative and quantitative studies focused on PPE performance into larger-scale investigations focused on aerosol dispersion in indoor environments. This will provide a more comprehensive outlook on workplace health and safety, where the use of PPE is not only often mandated by local legislature, but also can help mitigate the limitation of available ventilation options.
The present study is aimed at bridging the gap between studies focused on face mask efficacy assessment and indoor dispersion of aerosols by experimentally evaluating the aerosol accumulation in a controlled indoor environment, with various types of face masks and ventilation settings considered. Typical nasal breathing is modeled in the present work using a high-fidelity physical model. While this type of expiration is known to produce the lowest aerosol counts per event, this type of breathing is the most common type of expiration and thus accounts for the majority of aerosol production during continuous occupancy at work and public places.
